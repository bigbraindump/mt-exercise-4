back to the very American Ideal of working Rights as human rights .
the Congress Keith Ellison and John Lewis have submitted a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade uniunions as citizens .
`` such as trade unions , &apos;&apos; said , the Central classejobs , &apos;&apos; said Ellison , the Ellison , a democrat from Minner Progressive Caucus in Congress .
so I am proud to join with the Ombudsman John Lewis the employees of the employees .
this travelling law gives workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination , because of the organisation of trade uniunions such as the other forms of discrimination - and the anti-value force .
the supplement of national labour law , in order to create an opportunity for discrimination of workers to the organisation of a trade representation to the organisation of a threat of justice - and in order to maintain the civilian initiative .
but it is not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , which Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislation , which return back to a very American idea .
despite the reputation that the trade unions in the past few years - in knowledge , Michigan and other countries in the whole country - Americans and other countries in all the world - Americans in all the world .
there have been a time to the millions of Americans , freedom , freedom , freedom , press freedom , press freedom , press freedom , press freedom , press freedom .
as the United States after the Second World War Japan &apos;s Second World War Japan .
in full conscious awareness that the workers and their trade unions in creation of a new Japan &apos;s creation , they use a language that explicitly explicitly explicitly that ` the rights of the workers of the work of the work of the workers on the United States and trade are guaranteed .
as the United States after the Second World War , David David Eisenhower and his stage to the German , a constitution that would be replaced by a strong democracy .
in recognition of the fact that the employees have to organize , and their voice in the new nation , the German a clause that the explicitly expliciting : `` the right to founding agreements , agreed to the working and economic conditions .
agreements , the agreements of this right or restricted , or to avoid it is null and nothing .
Lady Eleanor Roosevelt , Lady Eleanor Roosevelt Commission , which has been released by the General Human Rights in 1948 by the United Nations .
for Americans , Americans accept the basic press that work human rights are .
as a country in other countries , as civilian and democratic societies may agree that the right to the foundation of the Americans , the right to the foundation of a trade - and that these trade must take part in collective negotiations as equal partners .
after these rights in America complaints , it is quite very much to the American ideal to the American ideally lead to the people of the right to deal with a freedom and open society .
as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr.
the history is a great deal .
now everyone knows that the workers are not limited to the strength of nation , but they enlarged .
the living standards of the living standards of millions of people have created a market for industries and the entire nation of production .
those who attacks to work , forget the work , but the history .
the history , and we should do .
the formal recognition of working rights as human rights - and enlargement of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers - is long-term .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis to renewed the ideal that America , and the promise of democracy .
